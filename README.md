# klssn.com-drawing-server
A nodeJS socket.io server and API to serve up user drawing creations for my upcoming website relaunch.

Eventually I would like to make this into an npm module and just import it into my main site project.  For now, I'm running it as a separate server in conjunction with the main site/blog server.
